                <h2>Morgan Sweeney</h2>
                <div class="desc"><p>Hey everybody! Gigantic warmth to you all. In our journey together in Bitsnbytes, the main motto is transforming ourselves from a bit to a byte. So, let's immerse ourselves in this insanely inquisitive world of knowledge.

                    To begin with, imagine you were to connect two computers, you either connect the two using an ethernet cable or connect both the computers to the same wifi. Taking into consideration only physical cables, we connect by using ethernet cables. 


                    Now, a group of 10 friends wants to mutually connect their computers using these ethernet cables. They will be able to do so but there must be 9 plugs in each computer and 45 ethernet cables altogether. Ah! That's tedious… Instead, they decide to bring a device called a router.ROUTER just acts as a mediator, takes information from one computer and sends that to another.


                    
A group of 10 more friends from other school wish to join this network. With all the same arrangement of computers and a router, they build another network which in turn is connected to the first router. Such a network comes very close to the INTERNET but we are missing something, moreover setting up cables everywhere is a really bad idea.


So wondering how to handle this? Well, there are already many cables linked to our house:-electric cables, telephone cables etc. A telephone infrastructure already connects our house with anyone in the world. So isn't this the perfect cable we had been searching for? Absolutely yes! We now connect our network to the telephone cable but there is a problem. The computer deals with digital data whereas telephone wires analog. For converting the information from our network to the information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice-versa, a piece of equipment called MODEM is required.


The next step is to send messages from one computer to another. In order to make that possible, we'll have to connect our network to an INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER(ISP). If you wish to send messages don't you think you'll need the address of that particular computer? 

Yes, we do! For that ISP provides a unique address to each computer called an IP(INTERNET PROTOCOL) address which is a series of 4 numbers separated by dots.eg:123.456.78.9 .After all, we are humans and we have a hard time remembering such a string of numbers! Hence there exists something called the DOMAIN NAME(a human-readable form of the  IP address).eg: www.google.com is the domain name used on top of the IP address 173.194.121.32
Let’s dive deep into these DOMAIN NAMES


Consider some domain names like www.google.com, www.youtube.com, www.wikipedia.org, www.stanford.edu... If you observe them, you'll be able to figure out that each domain name consists of two important parts.....TDL(TOP LEVEL DOMAIN) and SLD(SECONDARY LEVEL DOMAIN).TLD is the last part or, the extension of the domain whereas SLD is the data present before the TLD which will either be the name of the company, brand or the actual name of the website.
There are officially 4 different types of TLDs:
    1.GTLD:Generic TLD
    2.STLD:Sponsored TLD
    3.CCTLD:Country code TLD
4.infrastructure TLD


*GTLD: .com,.net,.org,.biz are some of the examples of GTLD's.say a domain name has ".com" extension then it"s intended use would be mainly for commercial entities. Similarly ".net,.org,.biz" extensions or TLD"s  are intended to be used for websites dealing with network infrastructure, organizations and business respectively.

*STLD: this is a type of TLD that is sponsored and is taken care of by private organizations, businesses or the government.  Some of STLD's include ".edu,.gov, .travel, .tel"  whose intended use will be for educational institutions, US government agencies, travel agencies, internet communication service websites respectively.

*CCTLD: this is a type of  TLD that is specified to countries. Have you ever come across websites of amazon like "amazon.in" and "amazon.co.uk" and many more like that? Have you ever wondered how could amazon post a whole new set of clothes and jewellery section on festive seasons like Diwali on its website, as these festivals are regionally celebrated in India and not in other parts of the world? Will people of other parts of the world also see those lit candles and new sections on amazon"s website during Diwali? Seems easy but here's the actual technical answer:- 
Amazon has specific websites or, say specific CCTLD"s which aids in building localized markets to fit the needs of different countries.



*infrastructure TLD: ".arpa "is the only TLD present here. With the help of this domain name, we can reach the root of the name hierarchy by reverse mapping of IP addresses of the domain names.



               
GLIMPSE:)
1.How we built a network using ethernet cables, routers and modems.
2.IP address and Domain names
3.parts of a domain name(TLD, SLD)

HOPEFULLY, this bit was a knowledgeable nugget, which helps us in growing from a bit to a byte......kb, MB, GB, TB eventually.

happy learning!!!!!
